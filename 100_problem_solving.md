Use statistical analysis
Execute SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
Utilize mathematical modeling
Conduct competitive analysis
Apply game theory for strategic decision-making
Use Six Sigma methodologies for process improvement
Perform trend analysis
Develop logical frameworks
