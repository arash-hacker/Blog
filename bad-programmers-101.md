I just read other people's code and always wonder how things work

Jump to coding w/o Evaluate solutions and Analyze them

You are OK with the first solution that works

They don't care about the reason why they're coding - the thing they're supposed to make work

They don't care about how they go about coding - best practices, methodology, modularization, architecture...

They don't care about understanding what needs to be done before they start coding - they jump right in

They don't care about the language they're going to use - anything goes, the looser the better

They don't care about putting in the work that's needed to build things the right way - they'll take shortcuts just because "look, it works like this!"

They don't care about tracking their progress and making sure others can understand what they're doing - after all, bug trackers are only needed when your code has bugs, right?

They don't care about writing tests and documentation - if you want to understand what the code does, why don't you just look at it?

They don't care about your advice nor your opinion, because, quite frankly, they already know better

Not making code readable. Making code that frightens other developers from changing it

- Assuming your code will work, rather than testing that it does

- Not allowing for users to make mistakes, then be able to recover

- Not handling special cases and edge cases

- Not doing working slices through a system to prove initially that it all fits together and basically works

- Worrying about things that simply don't matter: like optimising for disk space when you have lots of it

- Avoiding conflict. Learning later that a decent discussion with disagreements would have stopped me wasting time going down the wrong path.

You never try new things when you are asked for (software, libraries, coding style, and languages).

You use the phrase "I don't know how to do that" and never try to learn how to do "that".

Working without understanding the problem
